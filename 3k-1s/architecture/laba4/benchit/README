1. Quickstart (Console)

To use BenchIT a C compiler is required and your operating system has to be POSIX compatible. With this minimal set of conditions a complete reference run is possible. Some BenchIT kernels need additional libraries or compilers for other languages.

 - First step is to run the 'tools/FIRSTTIME' script.
 - For a reference run just execute 'reference_run.sh'

You can find additional measurement kernels in the kernel/ subdir. To proceed with one of these you have to: 

 - Select one and edit its PARAMETERS file
 - Run ./COMPILE.sh path/to/your/kernel
 - Run ./RUN.sh bin/your-kernel-binary

All results can be found in the corresponding subdir of output/

-----------------------

2. Quickstart (GUI)
 - Run ./GUI.sh
 - Select a kernel from the kernel tree and edit its PARAMETERS file
 - 'compile and run' should be selected by default in the toolbar, otherwise select it
 - Press the execute button in the toolbar

 - Results can be viewed by changing to results tree and select a result file

-----------------------

3. Experimental Hardware Detection

In tools/hw_detect you can find BenchITs hardware detection. This will give you the opportunity to get deeper information about your CPU. Sizes and types of caches, codename, gate length etc.

 - Follow the instructions in tools/hw_detect/README for usage
