* SYNOPSIS
* README file for benchit kernel
* "Jacobi Poisson Equation Solver"

* This file is part of the benchit project of the Center for
* High Performance Computing at the Dresden University of
* Technology.

* DESCRIPTION
* -----------------------------------------------------------
* Content
* 1) What the kernel does
* 2) Tips
* 3) What if every approach to get it work fails?
* -----------------------------------------------------------
*
* 1) The kernel solves the Jacobi Poisson Equation. It measures
*    the calculation time and floating point operations per second.
*
* -----------------------------------------------------------
* 
* 2) Variables are in COMPILE.SH.
*    JSTEPSIZE is the value for the increment of the size of
*    the matrix with each bi_entry call.
*    JMAX tells benchit, how often bi_entry is to be called.
*    The product of JSTEPSIZE and JMAX results in the largest
*    matrix' dimension minus 2 (JSTEPSIZE*JMAX + 2 = MAXDIM).
*    JNXY tells the kernel how many threads it should use. But be
*    aware that this number is the square root of the thread number.
*    JNXY=2 means, the kernels will use 2*2=4 threads! You must
*    pay attention to choosing a NXY so that (JMAX mod NXY) = 0!
*    With JMITS you can fine-tune the accuracy of the
*    calculation. To pass the abortion test JMITS should be
*    greater than 200+MAXDIM.
*    On home PCs a MAXDIM of 242 is fine. On high end systems
*    you might want to extend it up to 1002 (that's for year
*    2004 in ten years you might even need to insert more
*    zeros between 1 and 2).
*    To change those variables you don't have to edit the
*    COMPILE.SH. Just export them to your environment before you
*    execute the kernel.
* 
*    If you compile with -DUSE_SIZE_FITTED_MATRICES the
*    kernel will allocate memory for the used matrices with
*    every kernel entry according to the current dimensions.
*    This might be removed some day and instead become
*    fixed part of the kernel to compare the results with or
*    without this option.
