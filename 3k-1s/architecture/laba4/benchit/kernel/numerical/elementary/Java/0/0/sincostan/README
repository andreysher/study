the kernel isn't really comparable to the C and F77 version, the cause:
	- temp=sin(temp);  instead of  y=sin(x);
		-> Java version has data dependencies in each loop (for more detail read the code)
	- without this Java makes some unknown optimizations and the result is crap
	- no possibility to solve this, even subroutines like in the C version doesn't work
